  - Here is attached a screenshot of the result

- My process
  - Built with HTML + CSS
  - First of all, I've imported the proper google font 'Outfit' from the Google Fonts repository. First, I wrote the html code in the body to place all the necessary elements together. I found it better to wrap all the content in a single container. The most dificult part for me was to place the container in the middle of the viewport. I did it using "display:flex" with "align-items:center" in the body section along with "margin: 0 auto" in the container. The rest of the CSS code was simply designed parameters to match the requested result.
